# AutomatingChessGameplay

The maincode_wright.py script is a Python-based solution that utilizes Playwright, a powerful automation framework, to seamlessly track and retrieve every move made by a user on Lichess. Once a move is detected, it is analyzed in real-time using FairyStockfish, an advanced chess engine capable of evaluating board positions with high precision. The computed best move is then sent back to the user, ensuring optimal gameplay assistance. This implementation is designed for efficiency and accuracy, making it a valuable tool for real-time chess analysis and decision-making.

Pyqt was employed in designing UI for the controls of the project and other measures were take to prevent bot detection tools.
