# AutomatingChessGameplay

The maincode_wright.py script is a Python-based solution that leverages Playwright to track and retrieve user moves on Lichess. Each move is analyzed in real-time using FairyStockfish, providing the best possible response for optimal gameplay assistance.

PyQt powers the user interface, offering intuitive controls, while measures are in place to bypass bot detection. The Speedtest library ensures network stability for seamless Playwright performance. Additionally, C and Cython enable nanosecond-level sleep for enhanced hardware efficiency.

This implementation prioritizes speed, accuracy, and reliability, making it a robust tool for real-time chess analysis.
